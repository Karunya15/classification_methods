Title: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION  
TASK: to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck
ABOUT THE DATASET: the training set, provide the outcome  for each passenger.  Model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. The dataset consists of 891 rows and 12 columns. 
survival:	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes (TARGET VARIABLE)
pclass:	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex:	Sex	
Age:	Age in years	
sibsp:	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch:	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket:	Ticket number	
fare:	Passenger fare	
cabin:	Cabin number	
embarked:	Port of Embarkation
APPROACH: THE MODELS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION :
LOGISTIC REGRESSION
RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
K NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
XGBOOST
Used the bar graphs and heatmap to study the features, worked on missing values, and labelled encoding for string values. Using the ML model to predict accuracy score. Further used train test split and used SMOTE for the imbalanced dataset to get better accuracy. Lastly testing the trained model on the test dataset
